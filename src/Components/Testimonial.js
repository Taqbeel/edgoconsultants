Nilesh helped me secure my MBA with a full merit scholarship and Graduate Assistantship at the University of Connecticut School of Business, crafting my statement of purpose and letter of recommendation to perfection. He is knowledgeable, professional, and genuinely dedicated to helping his clients succeed. Unlike other consultancies where they will send students to the college that consultancies want or they have to pay for consultancies' Marketing spent, Nilesh has integrity and honesty, always making recommendations based on the best interests of his clients. I am grateful for all that he has done for me and he has my highest recommendation. LinkedIn - https://www.linkedin.com/in/udith-ashoka/",
